This project is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game, built using Python's turtle module. In this game, you control a snake that moves around the screen to eat apples that appear at random positions. Each time the snake eats an apple, it grows longer, increasing the challenge of avoiding collisions with the walls or its own body.

The goal of the game is to eat as many apples as possible and achieve the highest score without running into the obstacles. This version of the Snake game features smooth animations, straightforward controls, and a simple scoring system, making it a fun and nostalgic experience for players of all ages.

Feel free to explore the code, suggest improvements, or add new features!
